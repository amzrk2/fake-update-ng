# Fake Update NG

Fake Update NG is an experimental open source project built with Vue.js.

It's basically the same concept as [Fake Update](https://fakeupdate.net/), but has a more detailed design with extensible multilingual and theme support.

Note that since this project was created with the intention of learning Vue, certain use of tools such as Vuex may be pretty redundant.
